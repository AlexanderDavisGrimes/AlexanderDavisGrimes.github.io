      <h2 class="indeed-title1">The Challenge</h2>
      <div class="text-container">
        <p>Indeed’s current help center was designed by Zendesk, therefore the ability to restructure the information and update the UI is limited. If we move forward utilizing the current site, we’d need to consult with the appropriate party,
          at Zendesk, to make the necessary updates.</p>

        <p>Because the site is not owned by Indeed’s design/engineering teams it becomes more difficult to ensure the relevance of subject matter offered. Are we staying on trend with Indeed’s design practices and updating all new
          product/feature enhancements as they roll out?</p>

        <p>How can we design a help center that is consistent with Indeed’s branding, owned & maintained solely by Indeed, and instill the confidence of our users when it comes to accessing answers to their questions?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column-8">
          <h2 class="indeed-title1">Why Redesign?</h2>
          <div class="text-container">
            <p>With the Q1 roll-out of the multi-channel structure, the parameters of my role shifted to primarily assisting clients over the phone. Through my interactions, I’ve had the ability to listen directly to our clients' struggles with
              our site. Some call in upset about technical issues, others call to voice their frustrations with certain products or processes, but I've noticed an overwhelming amount of calls are directly related to navigational issues.</p>

            <p>Simply put, users, specifically employers, do not know how to use our site which results in a staggering amount of calls that we receive related to FCRs (first contact resolutions) such as opening and closing jobs.</p>

            <p>As a UX designer, this made me curious as to why. Why are our clients calling in needing assistance with tasks they can process on their own? Why are we having general, “What is Indeed” conversations rather than conversations
              attributed to best practices and/or performance optimization? Why are our clients not searching for the answers to their questions, and if they are, why do they ultimately end up calling the mainline? Why???<p>

                <p><i><span style="font-weight:bold;">Indeed is prided as being a self-service platform,</span></i> whose purpose is to connect potential candidates with eager employers. Because the platform was initially conceptualized for ease of
                  use from a job-seeker’s standpoint, it is time
                  that a more comprehensive 'employer help center' is created to ease the functionality of our site. This is <b>WHY</b> the redesign comes into play - to answer all of the other whys.</p>

                <p>f Indeed is truly self-service, then we need to offer the information required for our clients/users to do just that, self-serve.</p>

      <h2 class="indeed-title1">The Redesign</h2>

      <div>
        <h3 class="indeed-title">Landing Page</h3>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/indeed/indeed_info_v2_opt.svg" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/indeed/indeed_info_v2.svg" alt="Indeed">
        </picture>
      </div>
      <div class="text-container">
        <p><b>1.</b> The first change I made to the landing page was adding a header. There is no header on the current site, so I wanted to add one to provide additional links for navigational purposes.</p>

        <ul>

          <li>
            <p>The Indeed for employers logo was placed in the top left corner of the screen to redirect users back to the Employer’s splash page.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The Indeed <b><span style="color: #0A5FF7;"> "i"</span></b> icon is a new feature that was implemented to indicate information. This feature is intended to work similarly to a help or support button. Incorporating the <b><span style="color: #0A5FF7;">
                  "i" </span></b> is a great way to stay on trend with Indeed’s branding,
              but also allows us the opportunity to rebrand the help center as an information portal.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Indeed Academy houses a plethora of comprehensive webinars that clients can take at their leisure. The link to our webinars is not noticeable, so I included the link directly in the header to call attention to additional resources.
              This is a direct push to encourage clients to continue to educate themselves about our site.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>A link to our Products menu was also included to increase visibility to the array of products that we offer for recruitment needs/services.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Lastly, the ‘Sign In’ link and ‘Post a Job’ button were included, to redirect users to the Sign In page so they can easily access their account or create a new one.</p>
          </li>

        </ul>


        <p><b>2.</b> I used the tagline, “Info. At your fingertips,” because I wanted to change the mindset of our clients. We can empower them to look for information about our site, by simply changing the verbiage we use. This is also on trend
          with the
          rebrand of the “info center” rather than the help center. The intent is to switch the mindset of needing help to accessing information.</p>

        <p><b>3.</b> Next, I restructured the layout of the content. I included a <b>“Trending Topics”</b> section which will remain static in the middle of the page. The five topics that were selected are directly correlated with the most FCR
          related calls we
          receive, so I wanted to place them in the middle of the screen for easy accessibly. Underneath the trending topics, an <b>“FAQ”</b> section was included, so users can quickly find answers to some of the most popular questions/concerns
          about the
          site. Lastly, a <b>“More Articles”</b> section was included at the bottom of the page to allow users to take a deeper dive to access more information.</p>

        <p><b>4.</b> I divided the sections into three because it places the most in important information towards the top of the page, but continues to promote engagement with our site as users continue to scroll.
          This way we are adequately providing users with a variety of resources to utilize to help themselves from the top to the bottom of the page.</p>

      <div>
        <h3 class="indeed-title">Search Bar Enchancement</h3>

          <img src="img/indeed/indeed_info_v2_C2.svg" alt="Indeed">
        </picture>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="text-container">
        <p><b>1.</b> I widened the search bar to make it very prominent on the page. Users want to have the ability to search the site, so I placed the search bar in the top center of the page for quick access.
          No matter what page the users is on, they will always have the option to run a quick search query.</p>

        <p><b>2.</b> Suggestive text/search is another feature enhancement of the search bar. Currently, when users type into the search bar it does not auto-populate suggestions based on what is typed in. Since Indeed, is indeed <b><span style="color: #FF5A1F ;">(get
              it?)</span></b>, a search
          engine the info center should function as such.Through keyword recognition, when a user types in the search bar it will auto-populate relevant content. The user then has the option to narrow down their search results by completing their
          query, or they can quickly scale & access one of
          the suggested articles.</p>

        <p><b>3.</b> By implementing this feature, it not only gets them to answers faster, but it will also subconsciously teach users how to process search queries on our site.
          Whether it's through our Info center, Resume, or Sponsored jobs products, by having uniformity through functionality users will instinctively know how to use our site.</p>

      <div>
        <h3 class="indeed-title">More Articles</h3>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/indeed/indeed_info_helpguides_v2_opt.svg" media="(max-width:767px)">

        <img src="img/indeed/indeed_about_indeed_helpguides_expanded.svg" alt="Indeed">
      </picture>

      <div class="text-container">
        <p><b>1.</b> I added the <b>"More Articles"</b> option towards the bottom of the screen to allow the users that want a more holistic understanding of our site, the ability to access high-level help guides.</p>

        <p><b>2.</b> Once an article is selected, it will expand in a larger view to allow users to source through the information at their own pace. In the expanded view the <b>"More Articles"</b> topics will display on the left-hand side of the
          page to
          optimize navigation. Instead of having to navigate back to the previous page, users will have the ability to scroll through each article and their subtopics which will enhance their learning experience.</p>

        <p><b>3.</b> I designed the expanded view page to follow the same sleek modern aesthetic as outlined in Indeed’s design principles. By incorporating white space,
          it is easier for users to digest all of the information being presented. Additionally, by having a variety of options to search for information, we are increasing user engagement.</p>

        <p>Users can easily run a query via the search bar, view more articles on the left-hand side of the screen, redirect via links that are embedded within an actual article,
          and/or access recently viewed or related topics. However one chooses to navigate the site, I made accessing informational content as seamless as possible.</p>

        <p><b>4.</b> The intent of the redesign is to lower the number of FCR inquiries, however, it is impossible to address every question and concern.
          Because we want to assist our clients and offer world-class customer experiences, users need to be able to reach us, which is why I included a revised contact web form.
          The form was strategically placed towards the bottom of the screen, because the hope is that users find the information they need prior to having to reach out.</p>
      </div>

        <h3 class="indeed-title">Instructional Guides</h3>

        </picture>
      </div>

      <div class="text-container">
        <p><b>1.</b> Another great feature that I added is the instructional video guides. In conjunction with the Indeed Academy webinars, I suggested we incorporate visuals for step-by-step processes.</p>
        <ul>

          <li>
            <p>Similar to the functionality of other articles, when a user selects “How to Post a Job,” or any multi-step process article, it will expand in a larger view. I am proposing that we incorporate video tutorials in addition to the
              written step-by-step process. By doing so, we are speaking to multiple learning styles and setting our users up for success. It is a great way to promote the amazing members of the Client Success Team all while adding a personalized
              touch to our instructional guides.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <br><br>

      <h2 class="indeed-title1">Next Steps</h2>
      <div class="text-container">
        <ul>

          <li>
            <p>Work with Design and Engineering teams to build out a fully functioning Info Center that follows the redesigned UI.</p>
          </li>



          <li>
            <p>Test usuability of the site on current CS members and collect feedback based on the findings (since current CS members are not completely familiar with current the help center).</p>
          </li>



          <li>
            <p>Roll out beta testing to users in selects markets and meausre the number of FCR related calls over selected period of time.</p>
          </li>



          <li>
            <p>Continue to iterate based on the findings, and fully roll out the UI redesign to 100% of users.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <br>

      <h2 class="indeed-title1">Conclusion</h2>
      <div class="text-container">
        <p><i><span style="font-weight:bold;">What I learned from this redesign proposal…,</span></i></p>



        <p>I’ve learned that not every design challenge requires a fully drawn out product overhaul. User issues can be addressed through simple design practices, and that it is key to stay in tune with your organization’s design principles.
          Also, is the proposed redesign aligned with the current needs of the business? It is easy to pinpoint problems, but it is not always a simple fix.
          Everything has a trickle effect, so it is essential to consider all stake-holders when proposing to make changes.</p>
